 ## Purpose 
 There were two main purposes behind creating this portfolio website. The first was to give the people viewing the site a better insight to me as a person and a little bit of the work I have done. As time goes on more content and recent work can be added giving an indication of the work I have done and how far I have come in terms of skill.
 
 The second reason of this site was to display the skills I have obtained in HTML and CSS in my short time using them. This portfolio gave me an ideal opportunity to reflect on what I have learnt, gain a deeper knowledge in certain concepts (e.g. flexbox). It enabled me to put the theory into practice rather than explanations of hot to implement certain methods.

 ## Fuctionality & Features
 The website was designed with a simple interface that is easy to navigate. It was under the thought process that the user did not need to be overwelmed when viewing the initial page then would be able to navigate when they gain a brief rundown of what the site is about.

 The navbar has the hover feature implemented so the when the curser hovers over a link to another page it displays the first image displayed on that page enabling easier navigation also added was the change in colour scheme in the navbar so the user will always know their current location in the site.

To summarise website was designed with a simple interface to not overwhelm the user with easy navigation and clear concise information in order to make the best first impression possible.

## Target Audience
As stated a little above the website was designed to give a little insight into me as a person and with that in mind it was created with the view that potential employers and clients would be viewing this page. As such the site was designed with a simple, clean interface, concise and direct with the content and not having so much going on that the potential users wouldnt know where to look.
